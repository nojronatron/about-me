## About Me

I built this app so you could learn a little bit about me, and to demonstrate my software developer capabilities. The web app will ask you some questions about me, and treat you nicely with some responses, then welcome you to the main page.

### Author: Jon Rumsey

Thanks go to classmate Kyle Honaker for help with some CSS rules, and suggestions about layout.

### Links and Resources

- The css reset code on [MeyerWeb.com](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)  
- ESLinter code from CodeFellows (an internal link)  

### Reflections

Git Flow should follow this pattern throught this class:

1. git add file  
2. git commint -m ''  
3. git push  

The purpose is to ensure that others working on the same project get your file adds and updates, keeping their code in sync with yours, and vice-versa.
